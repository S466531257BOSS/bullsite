Due to the fact i wanted to ask GitHub-Support, but then recognized i am not at all able to communicate the thoughts behind :

Hi.

The subject already labeled my request in full :

Setup(-Info) : GitHub (-free ) as Site-Source-Host and FailSafe-Mirror .

I'd like to know if there is either
- a recommended way to accomplish the requested SetUp manually using GitHub ( Site / SoftWare )
or else
- any ideas where to search for answers or possibly known tutorials ( any direction welcome )
.

But to fulfill this mission you surely need some details; here they are:

TARGET:

: Resulting in Static WebPages generated of Content openly viewable and under respect of licenses reproducible / copyable / editable hosted on a free GitHub-Repository .

- means it should result in generated content, from contents in ORIGIN hosted on a github-repository but in TARGET generated on a hosted site, whereas the possibilities this deployment is based on should be managed via the github-repository.


: Git-Hup-Repository Content should not be used as active host/generator for resulting website, instead only as template / basement for the Site the content is used on.

- Like a php/sql-based cms that CAN run live, but also delivers static pages to cache requested pages; if this behaviour is forced, any cms giving this option can be used as webspace/hosted editor for multi-user editing but let visitors only access cached pages, comparable to a final publishing/syncronization .
- So i am aiming on a workflow / software that can be run on a hosted site ( comparable to : Running WordPress and use mail-post-publishing, whereas the posts via mail are delivered, from a random instance of WordPress ( the host itself, another site, another SoftWare that is used to produce the mails, etc. )

The hosted serving generator client ( if i may say so ) should use github ( or comparable hoster ) as a cvs, to deliver the possibility of running this client, which itself is a decentralized variant/perspective of the original github-content.

Woah, sorry that's like lookin in the mirror seeing i am looking at me looking in the mirror; My apologies, i think right now i am confused enough myself on how to explain what i'm asking for.

Nevertheless i send it to you, right now.

Maybe you have a better idea of what my idea was. Thanks for your interest.

And any answers ( or questions ) are welcome.

THANKS.
